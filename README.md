# About this specialization

This specialization develops strong programming fundamentals for learners who want to solve complex problems by writing computer programs. Through four courses, you will learn to develop algorithms in a systematic way and read and write the C code to implement them. This will prepare you to pursue a career in software development or other computational fields.

Successful completion of this Specialization will be considered by admissions as a demonstration of your skill and enhance your master’s application to Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering.

# Applied learning project

Projects include writing a sorting algorithm and writing a program to use Monte Carlo simulation to calculate poker hand probabilities. The poker project is divided over three courses, so you can write the more challenging parts of the program as you gain more advanced skills.
